# Modest Movie Metadata

[![Ruff](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astral-sh/ruff/main/assets/badge/v2.json)](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)

A very simple tool to generate [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) folder 
names using data from IMDb. By way of example, for the television show 
[Blackadder](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084988/), this tool will
generate the folder name `Blackadder (1982) [imdbid-tt0084988]`:

Designed to be as efficient as possible, you use it hands-free:

1. Monitors the clipboard for IMDb IDs, e.g. within a URL. 
2. Automatically writes generated folder names to the clipboard.

If you prefer, you can enter only the title and year, and attempt to look 
up the IMDB ID using this tool. However, in practice, it is typically easier to 
search for the content on the IMDb website using a web browser, and then simply 
copy the URL to the clipboard.

The program does not create or monitor folders on the file system.

Developed with Python 3.12, PySide 6.6, and 
[Cinemagoer](https://github.com/cinemagoer/cinemagoer).
Tested under Windows 10 and 11.

This project is not affiliated with Jellyfin or IMDb.

## Installation

To install the program on Windows, click on the
[Releases link here in GitHub](https://github.com/damonlynch/modest-movie-metadata/releases), 
and download the installer for the latest version.

The installer is only for 64-bit Windows 10 and 11. It should work equally 
well on Linux and macOS, but to use it you need to know how to install Python 
packages and run a Python script. If somebody would like to volunteer to 
produce a macOS installer, I would be delighted (I don’t own a Mac myself). 
If there is demand, I can create a Linux installer.  

## Licence
GPL 3.0 or later.
